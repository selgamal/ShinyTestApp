# ShinyTestApp
Testing Shiny as a Reporting and analytics tool. The app provides some information and analysis for 95 stocks based on daily prices between Jan 1,2008 to Dec 29, 2017. See on shinyapps.io [here](https://selgamal.shinyapps.io/ShinyTestApp/).

This app is created for testing purpose; I want to see if I can use shiny apps as a convenient and portable reporting and analysis tool. It includes functionalities I would like to use in my work; in addition to other functionalities I read about from other contributors, and it is all adapted to provide the information about stocks. 

## **WARNING**
This app is NOT intended to support any investment analysis or decisions and there is NO guarantee regarding the accuracy of data or calculations included in this app, the sole purpose of this app is to experiment with and test shinyApps.
